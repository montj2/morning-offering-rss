<h2 class="block-heading">The Morning Offering</h2>
<p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world, for the salvation of souls, the reparation of sins, the reunion of all Christians, and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month. Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
"I see clearly with the interior eye, that the sweet God loves with a pure love the creature that He has created, and has a hatred for nothing but sin, which is more opposed to Him than can be thought or imagined." <strong>St. Catherine of Genoa </strong></blockquote>

<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“If we have any distinct concept of blessedness connected with mourning, it could likely have been that it is a blessed thing to be rid of it. Are not mourners by widely accepted definition the unhappy ones? Obviously, if a mourner is blessed, then it has to mean that he is blessed to have gotten out of this painful predicament, to have escaped from this sorrowful situation, to have fended off suffering. And so we might well have written the third Beatitude like this: Blessed are they who enjoy the comfort of not having anything to mourn about. But then we run up against the hard fact that this is just not what Christ said…We shall have to deal with the words that our blessed Savior uttered and not with the words that we think He ought to have uttered.”<br/>
—Mother Francis, PCC, p.36</p>

<blockquote>
"Make me understand the way of thy precepts, and I will meditate on thy wondrous works. My soul melts away for sorrow; strengthen me according to thy word! Put false ways far from me; and graciously teach me thy law! I have chosen the way of faithfulness, I set thy ordinances before me. I cleave to thy testimonies, O Lord; let me not be put to shame! I will run in the way of thy commandments when thou enlargest my understanding!" <strong>Psalm 119:27-32</strong></blockquote>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Catherine of Genoa</h2>
<p>St. Catherine (1447–1510) was born into an aristocratic family in Genoa, Italy. She was a quiet, obedient, physically beautiful, and holy child who devoted herself to prayer and penance. At the age of 13 she made an attempt to enter a convent, but was rejected. At the age of 16 she consented to a marriage arranged by her family for political and financial gain. Her husband was faithless and violent, and their marriage was miserable. Catherine did not bear any children, and for the first five years lived as a hermit in her fine home. After this time, upon her family's rebuke of her solitude, she began to engage in the kind of social activity expected for her state in life. This only increased her weariness and depression, and led to the loss of her religious fervor. Catherine prayed earnestly for assistance in her trouble. Taking the advice of her sister, who was a nun, Catherine went to confession, and through the sacrament had a profound mystical experience in which she clearly saw the depth of her sinfulness contrasted with the depth of God's love. From that point on she renewed her commitment to rigorous prayer, penance, and works of mercy, and God continued to favor her with mystical visions. Catherine later won the conversion of her husband, and they were received into the Third Order of St. Francis. Together they cared for the poor and sick in the Genoa hospital, over which Catherine became administrator. St. Catherine's mystical visions were recorded by her confessor toward the end of her life, the most famous being her Treatise of Purgatory. Her feast day is celebrated on September 15th.</p>

<img alt="Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)" class="display-imagery" height="1" loading="lazy" src="https://static.trinityroad.com/sites/cc/morning_offering/saints/4329.png" width="1"/>
<h2 class="block-heading">Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>Devotion to Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa – Mother of Sorrows) became widespread in the Church around the 14th century. It was revealed to St. Bridget of Sweden (1303-1373) that devotion to Our Lady's Seven Sorrows would bring great graces. Mary, in a unique way, willingly suffered alongside her Divine Son as he gave his life to save the world, and she felt the bitterness of his passion as only a mother can. This devotion is especially remembered during September, the Month of Our Lady of Sorrows, and during the season of Lent. The Seven Sorrows of Mary are the Prophecy of Simeon, the Flight into Egypt, the Loss of Jesus for Three Days, the Carrying of the Cross, the Crucifixion of Jesus, Jesus Being Taken Down from the Cross, and Jesus Laid in the Tomb. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<img alt="Month of the Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)" class="display-imagery" height="1" src="https://static.trinityroad.com/sites/cc/morning_offering/saints/4964.png" width="1"/>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might.

<p>“In the case of biblical parables we must always expect that the addressees will be brought into a situation in which they believe they are going to enjoy a thrilling story—and then all at once everything changes: they are confronted with the will of God or the evil situation in which they are living in God’s eyes.”<br/>

<h2 class="block-heading">Pope St. Cornelius</h2>
<p>Pope St. Cornelius (d. 253 A.D.) was a Roman citizen and a holy priest who became the twenty-first successor to the chair of St. Peter, following a fourteen-month vacancy when Pope St. Fabian was martyred by Roman Emperor Decius. When the Emperor temporarily left Rome, the persecution against the Christians subsided long enough for the Church to elect St. Cornelius as the new Roman Pontiff. During Pope St. Cornelius' two year reign a great controversy arose as to what to do with Catholics who apostatized from the Christian faith under threat of death during the persecution. Many were being received back to the sacraments without any penance. In response to the scandal, some maintained that apostates could not be forgiven and could only be admitted back to the sacraments if they were re-baptized. Chief among them was a priest named Novatian, who, as a result of the scandal, caused a schism when he had himself consecrated as an anti-pope. In response, Pope St. Cornelius convened a synod of bishops to confirm his rightful authority as Pope. Novatian was excommunicated and his doctrine was condemned as heresy. Pope St. Cornelius proclaimed that the Church had the power and authority to forgive repentant apostasy, and that converted apostates could be readmitted to the sacraments after true contrition with adequate penance. Soon a new wave of persecution against the Christians broke out, and Pope St. Cornelius was driven into exile and martyred. His feast day is celebrated on September 16th.</p>

<img alt="Month of the Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)" class="display-imagery" height="1" src="https://static.trinityroad.com/sites/cc/morning_offering/saints/4964.png" width="1"/>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">Daily Prayers</h2>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.<em> Our Father. Hail Mary.</em></p>

<h2 class="block-heading">The Morning Offering</h2>
<p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world, for the salvation of souls, the reparation of sins, the reunion of all Christians, and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month. Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
"May the Holy Spirit enkindle you with the fire of His Love so that you may persevere, unfailingly, in the love of His service. Thus you may merit to become, at last, a living stone in the celestial Jerusalem." <strong>St. Hildegard von Bingen </strong></blockquote>
<strong>St. Hildegard von Bingen </strong>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“You have never begrudged the martyrs their triumph but rather trained them for it. And so I am asking you to be consistent with the lessons you teach them. Just beg for me the courage and endurance not only to speak but also to will what is right, so that I may not only be called a Christian, but prove to be one. For if I prove myself to be a Christian by martyrdom, then people will call me one, and my loyalty to Christ will be apparent when the world sees me no more. Nothing you can see is truly good. For our Lord Jesus Christ, now that he has returned to his Father, has revealed himself more clearly. Our task is not one of producing persuasive propaganda; Christianity shows its greatness when it is hated by the world.”<br/>
—St. Ignatius of Antioch, p. 194</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Hildegard von Bingen</h2>
<p> St. Hildegard von Bingen (1098–1179) was born to a large and noble German family. She began to have mystical visions at the age of three which continued throughout her life. Her parents, promising her to the service of God, sent her to be educated at the Benedictine Abbey by an anchoress when she was about eight years of age. At the age of fourteen she became a consecrated nun attached to the Abbey, where she lived a quiet life of prayer for many years. At the age of 38, after the anchoress' death, she was chosen as the new leader of a growing group of nuns. Hildegard led a remarkable and unusual life for a woman of her day. She was an avid composer of sacred music and liturgy, in addition to poems and plays. She also wrote heavily on theology, natural medicine, and natural science. At the age of 42, at the command of God, Hildegard began writing down what she saw in her visions. Her works were widely read, even by the Pope, and leaders around the world sought her council. Her fame as a mystic and prophetess grew, earning her the name "Sibyl of the Rhine." More nuns flocked to join her, causing Hildegard to establish a new monastery at Rupertsberg. She wrote proficiently on the harmony of created nature and man's need to live in balance with it, especially in virtue, morality, and the love of God, which led Pope Benedict XVI to declare her the fourth female Doctor of the Church in 2012 alongside Teresa of Avila, Catherine of Siena, and Thérèse of Lisieux.  Because her works were far ahead of her time she is regarded as a historical phenomenon. Hildegard of Bingen is considered the founder of scientific natural history in Germany. Her feast day is September 17th.</p>

<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.<em> Our Father. Hail Mary.</em></p>

<h2 class="block-heading">The Morning Offering</h2>
<p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world, for the salvation of souls, the reparation of sins, the reunion of all Christians, and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month. Amen.</p>

<strong>St. John of the Cross</strong>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“Marriage releases the flesh from its individual selfishness for the service of the family; the vow of chastity releases the flesh not only from the narrow and circumscribed family, where there can still be selfishness, but also for the service of that family that embraces all humanity. That is why the Church asks those who consecrate themselves to the redemption of the world to take a vow and to surrender all selfishness, that they may belong to no one family and yet belong to all. That is why in that larger family of the kingdom of God, the priest is called “Father” —because he has begotten children not in the flesh, but in the spirit.”<br/>
—Venerable Fulton Sheen, p. 117</p>

"Hark, your watchmen lift up their voice, together they sing for joy; for eye to eye they see the return of the Lord to Zion. Break forth together into singing, you waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord has bared his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God." <strong>Isaiah 52:8-10</strong></blockquote>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Joseph of Cupertino</h2>
<p>St. Joseph of Cupertino (1603-1663) was the son of a poor Italian carpenter. His father died before he was born, leaving his mother destitute. As a result Joseph was underfed and often sick. He was an intellectually dull child who constantly found himself the worse off in every situation. He was awkward, absent-minded, unintelligent, and difficult to be around. Many people thought he was good for nothing–including his own mother, who treated him harshly and considered him a burden. Added to the scorn he received from everyone, at the age of eight he began receiving ecstatic visions for which he was also ridiculed. At the age of seventeen Joseph found work with the Capuchin Franciscan friars, eventually joining their order once they recognized his holiness beneath his irritating demeanor. His ecstasies became more pronounced, and he would often levitate or float as they happened. These ecstasies could be triggered easily through the mention of anything heavenly, or by any mortification. These occurrences became a spectacle and disturbance to others and caused Joseph much suffering; they were a cross he would bear his whole life. For example, as a priest he could not celebrate Mass publicly due to his distracting ecstasies. He was even reported to the Inquisition for fear he was involved in witchcraft. Yet St. Joseph lived a life of deep prayer and severe penance through continual fasting, subjecting himself every year to seven Lents of forty days each. Sometimes called “The Flying Saint,” St. Joseph of Cupertino is also the patron of air crews and aviators. His feast day is September 18th.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might.

<h2 class="block-heading">The Morning Offering</h2>
<p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world, for the salvation of souls, the reparation of sins, the reunion of all Christians, and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month.

"The closer one approaches to God, the simpler one becomes." <strong>St. Teresa of Avila</strong></blockquote>
<strong>St. Teresa of Avila</strong>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“Meekness is spiritual; meekness is joy. And we should all strive to have in our hearts that joy that is contagiously cheerful. We need not think that we must be continually joking; nor should we believe that even-temperedness must express its happiness in laughter. We may and undoubtedly will have bothersome worries, but we can and should be even-tempered, retain our peace of heart, be meek in spite of them. We can at least bear with life’s small problems in such a way as not to allow them to rush upon others. Even temper is attractive, helps the community spirit, keeps down all that ends to anger for it seeks under varying circumstances to be pleasant, amiable, agreeable, mild, patient. It is, in fact, the practice of many virtues.”<br/>
—Matt Fradd, p.79</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Januarius</h2>
<p>St. Januarius (d. 305 A.D.), also known as San Gennaro, was the Bishop of Benevento, Italy. Little is known of his early life. He was arrested and imprisoned for his faith while visiting other Christians in jail during the persecution of Roman Emperor Diocletian. Many attempts were made to kill him, but one after another they failed. He was thrown into a fiery furnace, but he came out unscathed. He was then thrown to wild beasts in the amphitheater, but they did not attack. He was finally beheaded, and his blood was collected by Christians and kept in a sealed glass vial for veneration. The vial of blood is still kept today in the Naples cathedral, and it has continually demonstrated miraculous properties for which no scientific explanation has been offered. St. Januarius' blood liquefies and becomes fresh on particular occasions throughout the year, especially his feast day, for which the saint has become famous. This phenomenon has been occurring with regularity for centuries, and is one of the "blood miracles" that is historically well-documented among the relics of certain saints. He is the patron saint of blood banks and the city of Naples, Italy. St. Januarius's feast day is September 19th.</p>

<img alt="Month of the Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)" class="display-imagery" height="1" src="https://static.trinityroad.com/sites/cc/morning_offering/saints/4964.png" width="1"/>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<strong>St. Andrew Kim Taegon </strong>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“The second stage of contemplation and the sixth of prayer is that of quiet. This is the union of the will with God, who, as highest Good, attracts it forcefully so that in Him alone it may find its rest. Infinite power, goodness, gentleness, and sweetness, with God’s gifts of fear, piety, fortitude, and wisdom, overwhelm it and at the same time take it captive, set it ablaze, fill it with caresses, and drawing it near…there the soul finds for a time every now and then—times that seem to it short however long they last—its full rest, its refreshment and strength, its peace and happiness.”<br/>
—J.G Arintero, O.P., p.44-45</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Andrew Kim Tae-gon</h2>
<p> St. Andrew Kim Tae-gon (1821-1846) was born to a noble family in Korea, and was baptized at the age of 15 after his parents converted to the Catholic faith. Andrew's father, great-grandfather, and great-uncle were martyred during the government's staunch persecution against Christianity, leaving the remaining family in poverty. Andrew was later chosen to travel over 1,000 miles to the nearest seminary in China to be trained for the priesthood. He was ordained in Shanghai as the first native Korean priest in the Church's history of evangelizing in that country. He returned to Korea in secrecy to avoid detection by the authorities. Once back in his hometown, he worked to catechize the faithful until his bishop summoned him to Seoul to help smuggle French missionaries from China into Korea, with the aid of Chinese fishermen. During this operation he was caught and imprisoned by the border patrol, and charged as a traitor to his country. He was tortured and beheaded on September 16, 1846, at the age of 25. Pope John Paul II canonized Fr. Andrew Kim Tae-gon, along with 102 other Korean martyrs, on May 6, 1984. St. Andrew Kim Tae-gon is the patron saint of Korea. His feast day is celebrated on September 20th.  	 </p>

<img alt="Month of the Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)" class="display-imagery" height="1" src="https://static.trinityroad.com/sites/cc/morning_offering/saints/4964.png" width="1"/>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.<em> Our Father. Hail Mary.</em></p>

<h2 class="block-heading">The Morning Offering</h2>
<p>O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer you my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day for all the intentions of your Sacred Heart, in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world, for the salvation of souls, the reparation of sins, the reunion of all Christians, and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father this month. Amen.</p>
<blockquote>
"For me, prayer is a surge of the heart; it is a simple look turned toward heaven, it is a cry of recognition and of love, embracing both trial and joy." <strong>St. Therese of Lisieux</strong></blockquote>
<strong>St. Therese of Lisieux</strong>
<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Today's</span> Meditation</h2>
<p>“There is no such thing as a dull, futile, or useless experience. Every sorrow loses its sting, because everything is an opportunity to glorify God. Saint Paul wrote, “For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities: for when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Cor 12:10). Once you have learned to find contentment in adversity, all of life becomes changed with light and hope and joy.”<br/>
–J. Augustine Wetta, O.S.B, p. 103</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">St. Matthew</h2>
<p> St. Matthew the Apostle (1st c.) was a Jew who also went by the name of Levi. He was from Galilee and served in Capernaum as a tax collector for Herod Antipas before becoming a disciple of Jesus. It was in the home of St. Matthew that Jesus dined with the "sinners and tax collectors."  Under Jesus' influence St. Matthew was led to repentance for the evil he had done as a tax-collector, a position despised by his fellow Jews. He repaid those he cheated four-fold, sold all his possessions, and followed Christ as one of the twelve Apostles. St. Matthew preached among the Jews for fifteen years following the Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus. He is the author of the Gospel that bears his name, which he wrote to convince the Jews that Jesus Christ was the Messiah promised to Israel. According to tradition, St. Matthew the Apostle brought the Gospel to Syria, Media, Persia, Parthia, and finished his preaching in Ethiopia with a martyr’s death. He is the patron of guards, bankers, accountants, security forces, and stock brokers. His feast day is September 21st.</p>

<h2 class="block-heading"><span>Month of </span> Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa)</h2>
<p>The Church dedicates the month of September to Our Lady of Sorrows, also known as Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows). This devotion recalls the Blessed Virgin Mary’s spiritual martyrdom in virtue of her perfect union with the Passion of Christ. This was her role in salvation history, and what merited her place as the spiritual Mother of all Christians. This is symbolized by a single sword, or seven swords, piercing Mary's suffering heart, as foretold in Simeon's prophecy. Traditionally the Church meditates on the "Seven Sorrows" of our Blessed Mother: the prophecy of Simeon; the Holy Family's flight into Egypt; the loss of the Child Jesus for three days; the meeting of Mary and Jesus as he carried his cross; Jesus' crucifixion and death; Jesus' sacred body taken down from the cross; and Jesus' burial. The feast of Our Lady of Sorrows (Mater Dolorosa) is September 15th.</p>

<h2 class="block-heading">Daily Prayers</h2>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Dead</h3>
<p>In your hands, O Lord, we humbly entrust our brothers and sisters.<br/>
In this life you embraced them with your tender love;<br/>
deliver them now from every evil and bid them eternal rest.<br/>
The old order has passed away: welcome them into paradise,<br/>
where there will be no sorrow, no weeping or pain,<br/>
but fullness of peace and joy with your Son and the Holy<br/>
Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer of Spiritual Communion</h3>
<p>My Jesus, I believe that You are present in the most Blessed Sacrament. I love You above all things and I desire to receive You into my soul. Since I cannot now receive You sacramentally, come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there, and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You. Amen.</p>
<h3 class="sub-header">Prayer for the Holy Father</h3>
<p class="p1">Almighty and everlasting God, have mercy upon Thy servant, Pope Leo XIV, our Supreme Pontiff, and direct him, according to Thy loving kindness, in the way of eternal salvation; that, of Thy gift, he may ever desire that which is pleasing unto Thee and may accomplish it with all his might. Through Christ, Our Lord. Amen.<em> Our Father. Hail Mary.</em></p>
<em> Our Father. Hail Mary.</em>
